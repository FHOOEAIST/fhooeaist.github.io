Recent advancements in neural scene representations, specifically Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have revolutionized novel-view synthesis. However, these methods are predominantly optimized for and evaluated on ground-based, visible-spectrum (RGB) data, leaving a significant gap in their application to aerial, radiometric thermal imagery, which is critical for industrial inspection, search-and-rescue, and environmental monitoring. In this work, we systematically investigate the applicability of these state-of-the-art paradigms to radiometric thermal imagery acquired from airborne drone platforms. We introduce a novel, publicly available multimodal dataset captured using a DJI M30T system, comprising synchronized RGB and radiometric thermal frames of a building. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation comparing specialized thermal approaches (ThermalNeRF, ThermoNeRF, Thermal3DGS) against general-purpose methods (nerfacto, gsplat). Our assessment utilizes a suite of quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, MAE, LPIPS, and DISTS) complemented by qualitative visual analysis. Results indicate that Thermal3DGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in the thermal domain (PSNR 22.99, SSIM 0.845), effectively mitigating artifacts common in low-texture thermal data. Conversely, gsplat demonstrates superior RGB synthesis and competitive thermal performance, suggesting that general-purpose splatting representations are robust enough for cross-spectral applications. This work bridges the gap between aerial radiometric sensing and neural rendering, demonstrating that off-the-shelf drone thermography can be utilized for high-fidelity 3D thermal reconstruction with minimal adaptation.
