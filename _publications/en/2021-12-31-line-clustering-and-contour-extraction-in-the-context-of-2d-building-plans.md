For the purpose of analyzing a building according to its accessibility or structural resilience, printed 2D floor plans are not sufficient because of the missing link to semantic information.
This paper tackles this issue and introduces a concept for clustering classified lines of a floor plan and for creating semantically enriched contour elements based on different image processing, 
computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Based on a general line clustering approach, we introduce type specific methods for walls, windows, doors and stairs. 
The resulting clusters are in turn used for a contour creation, which uses minimal rotated rectangles. Those rectangles are transformed to polygons that are refined using post processing steps.The approach is evaluated via positive testing using a pixel-based comparison of the process’s result. For this, automatically generated as well as real world building plans are used. The final evaluation shows, that the concept reaches a confidence of >90% for door, stair and windows and only around 10% for stairs with the run-time linearly scaling with the size of the input.
