Elevators are an essential part of the lives of millions of people every day. Most people believe that elevators work 24/7 a year, but what about human problems like heart attacks and inability to press the emergency button? There exist real cases where people died in elevators, which could have been prevented if an autonomous system could have detected people with emergency need on the ground. An additional challenge for this project is to be GDPR compliant and by that not to monitor people using the elevators. Automatic emergency detection in elevators is of interest because it enables exactly that scenario of detecting human problems. The project where this is realized consists of a client running autonomously in the elevator and tracking the emergency state in it and optimizing background service. This work proposes a system that aims at solving the self-optimization of the classification in the elevators system as the background service. There exist more than one issue for such a system. First, how to extract the correct label from new arriving samples from a real emergency or action? Second, what is the most efficient parameter setting for a classifier and when is a classifier thoroughly tested and can be deployed to the client running in the elevator. The goal for this work is to present a prototype that aims at solving the main issues. One example, therefore, is the dynamic of new classes rising during the runtime and not wasting resources on creating a new flat classifier. The results further showcase, based on two different datasets, the amount of time that is required to find a better solution than manually searching for one and its downside. One of the most relevant results is the overall structure of the solution that combines state of the art technologies into one system and demonstrates a solution that is extendable in the future.
